#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1 How many orders were placed in January?
select count (orderid)
from bit_db.JanSales
where length (orderid) = 6;

#2 How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
select count (Product)
from bit_db.JanSales
where Product = 'iPhone';

#3 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
select distinct acctnum
from bit_db.customers cust
inner join bit_db.FebSales Feb
on cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
where length (orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
select distinct Product, price
from bit_db.JanSales
where price in (select min (price)
from bit_db.JanSales);

#5 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
select sum(quantity) * price as Revenue, product
from bit_db.jansales
group by product;

#6 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
select sum (quantity), Product,
sum(quantity) * price as Revenue
from bit_db.FebSales
where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
group by location;

# 7 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
select 
count(distinct cust.acctnum) as acct_num, 
avg(quantity*price) as avg_price_spent
from BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
left join BIT_DB.customers cust
on FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
where Feb.Quantity>2
and length(orderid) = 6 
and orderid <> 'Order ID';

#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
